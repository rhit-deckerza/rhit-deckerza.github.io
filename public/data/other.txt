      "description": "PolyRook is a decentralized, AI-powered 3D model platform that uses a torrent-like network to generate and share thousands of new assets daily, all fully tagged for quick filtering and easy integration.",
      "fullDescription": "The premise is simple: anywhere, anytime, anyone can use AI to spawn brand-new 3D meshes and access an infinite library. Then they seamlessly push and share these GLB creations across a fully distributed, torrent-like network. Our desktop app helps orchestrate local generation, seeding, and partial hosting. Meanwhile, the PolyRook API caters to developers who want dynamic, on-the-fly 3D asset loading for procedural or AAA games.",
